Today's students will be the researchers, teachers, politicians and industry leaders of tomorrow. Plagiarism is usually divided into intentional and unintentional plagiarism, and range from unintentional unreferenced citations to contracted cheating. A exploratory study of cheating by economics and business undergraduate students reveal that academtic dishonesty differ dramaticly in different parts of the world. Students admitting to cheat ranged from 5\% in Scandinavian countries to 88\% in Eastern European countries \cite{Teixeira2010}.
\\ \\
This literature study examens pervious work to find possible reasoning and countermeasurs for academic dishonesty. 
\\ \\
The competition among students is responsible for an increasing trend of acadmeic dishonesty \textbf{Godfrey and Waugh (1997)}. Cometition among students appear to be a positive thing, but getting ahead of competitors for jobs and academic positions is part of the incentive for intentional plagiarism and cheating. The likleyhood of copying is directly related to behaviour and attitue among fellow students \textbf{Bunn et al (1992)}, and majority of students consider plagiarism a minor problem or no problem at all \cite{Teixeira2010}.
\\ \\
Students contracting out their work is hard to detect, and more fraudulent than other forms of plagiarism \cite{Walker2012}.
